## React native vision camera 0.76.1 reproduce case

- Only affects android
- Tested on Pixel 3a API 33

## versions:

- RN version 0.76.1
- Vision camera: 4.6.1

## What occurs:

- See that the camera does not render below the header 100% of the time. The Camera will pop up to the top left of the screen.
- This may not happen every time so full quitting the app and reopening will help with this.
